The book _Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI_ by Yuval Noah Harari is about exactly what it says. 

Its main thesis is that information is a binding agent in social networks, which in order to grow need to balance between truth and order, or from another perspective, wisdom and power. An optimization in one direction is inherently a compromise in the other. I'm not too sure I agree with that part, at least in that it's a direct 1:1 mapping. 

His definition of the "naive view of information" is the common trope that more information will yield truth. He claims this is false, and the process of combating false information is to add more information, or the natural emergence of truth is through more and more information. 

He writes that discovering and working towards truth, which is defined as a representation of objective reality, is a very difficult and cumbersome process, whereas misinformation is easy and trivial to create and in some cases, easier to control social networks with. 

>[!NOTE] Anyone can say an untruth in an instant, and it takes much more time to prove it wrong or right. 

Additionally, any individual truth is inherently incomplete. It is some level of abstraction from the reality that exists. 

He defines three types of reality:
1. objective reality - President Lincoln was shot in the head, the moon orbits the earth
2. subjective reality - "Okra tastes good"
3. intersubjective reality - the US dollar, or bitcoin, has value

We have developed tools over the ages that have grown our ability to create information networks:
1. Stories - binding tribes together through shared narrative, but ultimately difficult to pass around and stay the same
2. Documents - keeping the story the same throughout the ages while also allowing for larger complexity because it doesn't need to be all kept in the brain and shared through story-tellers, but ultimately leads to bureaucracy which has a masking effect on how the system works. 

Documents lead to books, which are important in that they are the same piece of information that spreads without (hopefully), change. These are used as central pillars to large information networks to create the intersubjective reality of the network. 

It is important to note that even these books are subject to the infallibility of humans.

He then goes on to explain that the free flow of information doesn't always lead to truth (the naive interpretation of information). He does this by comparing the growth of witch hunts and related conspiracies vs the growth of the scientific revolution via the invention of the printing press. The former influence was from a book _The Hammer of the Witches_, which sold out and was widespread, instantly, leading to multiple versions and editions, leading to cult like fantasies and inquisitions against witches, killing tens of thousands of innocent people, even children. Even today, our modern vision of what witches are is shaped by this book and its cultural influence. 

On the other hand, Copernicus''s _On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies_ was hailed as "an all-time worst seller" by Arthur Koestler.
