- rub with S&P, then additionally do the fat cap with "crack lawry's"
	- 4 tbs lawry's
	- 1 tbs chicken bouillon
	- 1 tss ginger powder
	- 1 tsp mustard powder
	- 1/2 tsp chili powder
	- 1/2 tsp cayenne powder
- for bottom-up heat sources (BGE), cook first two hours fat cap up (200-225F), then flip down until shelf. This allows seasonings to settle and not get messed up when you flip fat down.
- wrap in butcher paper until done
- done when flat is 200 internally
