As I'm approaching 40 and thinking about what I've spent my time on up to now, trying to find a theme to the decisions I make and efforts I pursue, I've come to the conclusion that I'm infatuated with the concepts of "information" and its transference between things. I mean the most general thing you can think of when I say "information". 

The range of topics this covers is basically everything, from the fabric of the universe and the rules that govern it, the concept of entropy and how that fuels so many processes and innovation, how people move through the world and communicate with others, how technology shapes and remembers society, you name it. 

So there's a few things I want to write down that should help organize how I think about it all. There's a few different things to keep in mind that intertwine together. I'll spew them as a general idea to be expanded upon somehow, but this is mostly a brain dump of things I categorically think about when the word "information" enters my brain. 
- I see "data" as the exhaust of everything that happens. All things can be described by the process that some of that information being captured by some means and analyzed/processed to then derive insight useful for making actions. 
- The process of information transfer is lossy. This means that when you try to tell someone something, they aren't getting exactly what you're picturing in your head, but some version of it.
- The share-ability of something is multifaceted. The difference in understanding and world-view of the people involved, the ability of the sender to articulate the thing with the tools at hand (language and medium), the constraints of the medium in which the communication travels (air, digital communications protocol, art, etc), everyone's mood, personal bias, you name it. 
- If you discuss entropy, you're naturally discussing a process and comparing to some other state. Fundamentally, "Entropy" is the amount of "information that we don't know" about a system from its initial state to its final state, for some given process. It's accuracy is tied to our ability to determine the amount of information we don't know about a system in various states. 
- There's three parts of a message (Godel, Escher, Bach and my talk):
	- the indicator that allows for the ability to discern that a message exists
	- the process of deciphering the message
	- the actual meaning of the intended message
- Malcolm Gladwell's "Law of the Few" in his book, [_The Tipping Point_]() LINK HERE:
	- Connectors
	- Mavens
	- Salesmen
- The concept of Stephen Wolfram's "Ruiliad" is something that, if understood well, drastically helps with understanding all of these concepts and how they fit together.
