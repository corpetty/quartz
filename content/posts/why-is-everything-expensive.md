So everything is expensive these days. When looking for answers as to why, you're going to get the following from American political groups:
- Republicans: "Inflation"
- Democrats: "Corporate Greed"

My personal opinion feels that it's a significant combination of the two and has ties to external events and momentum generated from multiple administrations. In short, I think it's complicated and nuanced, like everything else. Let's look into it a bit to see what influences there are, and if we can find some evidence that holds weight. 

## General Metrics
So when looking at various explanations of this via every biased source that exists, you hear arguments based in a variety of metrics. Let's look at some of them.

### The Inflation Rate
I mean, if inflation is the main argument used by half of the country, we should probably look at it over the past decade along with general economic trends associated with its movement. 

Looking at the [US Inflation Calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/), we see a large spike from ~1.4% to 7% in 2020, and from there a slow but steady period of _disinflation_ back down to target levels (~2%).

According to the Bereau of labor and Statistics, this massive rise was primarily due to "energy prices, a backlog of work orders due to supply chain issues (Covid-19), and prices changes in the auto related industries.^[1]"

### Corporate Profits
