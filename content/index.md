I've reset my website to be a "digital garden." It's basically just a bunch of linked notes with all of my migrated articles I've written. I use this mostly to just make it so my notes are linkable to other people and sharable / discoverable. Hope you enjoy. If you don't, doesn't really bother me. 

Here are those [posts](/posts).

Here are the [notes](/notes).

Here is a blurb [about me](/about).

Here are my [scientific publications](/pubs).

Here are some [projects I'd love built](/future-projects) that I don't have time to do myself.

[Contact me](/contact.md) if you have a question/comment/concern. 

Personal [disclosure page](/disclosures.md) here. Thanks to Kevin Sekniqi for format and copy as a template.
